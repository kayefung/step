      <h1>Kaye's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Kaye and I love going to concerts, discovering new music, baking, and coding!</p>
      <img src="/images/strokes_concert.jpg">
      <p>I was born and raised in Markham, ON, a city just outside of Toronto.</p>
      <p>I currently attend the University of Toronto and study Industrial Engineering. I'm also planning
          on pursuing a minor in Artificial Intelligence. So far I've really enjoyed my programming
          and operations research courses and I'm interested in learning about ways that AI can be applied to
          operations research!</p>
      <p>At school I've volunteered as an instructor with Project Include, providing free coding bootcamps
          to underprivileged school-aged kids around Toronto. Additionally I've had a hand in planning the
          Engineering Faculty's Orientation Week, being responsible for Registration and Downtown
          Walkaround (a 1000+ person parade around Downtown Toronto).</p>
